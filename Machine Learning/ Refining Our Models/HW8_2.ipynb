Although they I expected them to further increase the model's accuracy when applied together, they actually made a smaller difference when applied all at once. I'm not sure why this is the case and tried changing some parameters in the process, however because of this I ended up commenting the part where I balanced the dataset. This seemed to leave me with the best performance out of the different changes I tried."
